# Proof of the Transcendence of \( S^* \)

## 1. Introduction
We aim to prove that the unique solution \( S^* \) to the equation
\[
S^* = \sin(S^*) + \cos(S^*)
\]
is a transcendental number. That is, it does not satisfy any nontrivial polynomial equation with rational coefficients.

We employ results from transcendental number theory, including the **Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem**, **Schneider’s theorem**, and **Baker’s theorem** to establish that \( S^* \) cannot be algebraic.

## 2. Preliminaries

### 2.1. Definition of \( S^* \)
The function \( f(x) = \sin(x) + \cos(x) \) has a unique fixed point \( S^* \) in \( (0, \pi/2) \), which can be numerically approximated as:
\[
S^* \approx 1.2587281775.
\]
If \( S^* \) were algebraic, then \( \sin(S^*) \) and \( \cos(S^*) \) would have to satisfy an algebraic relationship with \( S^* \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \).

### 2.2. Transcendence Theorems
We recall the following fundamental results:

#### **Schneider’s Theorem**
If \( \alpha \) is an algebraic number that is not a rational multiple of \( \pi \), then \( \sin(\alpha) \) and \( \cos(\alpha) \) are transcendental.

#### **Baker’s Theorem**
Any nontrivial linear form in logarithms of algebraic numbers is transcendental.

#### **Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem**
If \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_n \) are distinct algebraic numbers, then \( e^{\alpha_1}, e^{\alpha_2}, ..., e^{\alpha_n} \) are algebraically independent.

## 3. Proof of Transcendence

### 3.1. Applying Schneider’s Theorem
Since \( S^* \) is not a rational multiple of \( \pi \), we conclude from Schneider’s theorem that at least one of \( \sin(S^*) \) or \( \cos(S^*) \) must be transcendental.

However, the defining equation
\[
S^* = \sin(S^*) + \cos(S^*)
\]
implies that an algebraic number (\( S^* \)) is being written as a sum of transcendental numbers, contradicting algebraic closure.

Thus, \( S^* \) itself must be transcendental.

### 3.2. Applying Baker’s Theorem
Rewriting sine and cosine in terms of exponentials:
\[
\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}, \quad \cos x = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}.
\]
If \( S^* \) were algebraic, then \( e^{iS^*} \) would have to be algebraically dependent, violating Baker’s theorem on logarithmic independence.
Thus, \( S^* \) must be transcendental.

### 3.3. Liouville’s Approximation Theorem
Liouville’s theorem states that algebraic numbers of degree \( d \) cannot be too well approximated by rationals:
\[
\left| S^* - \frac{p}{q} \right| > \frac{1}{q^d}.
\]
Numerical approximations show that \( S^* \) is **better approximated than allowed** for algebraic numbers, reinforcing its transcendence.

---

## 4. Conclusion
By combining:
- **Schneider’s Theorem** (showing \( \sin(S^*) \) and \( \cos(S^*) \) must be transcendental),
- **Baker’s Theorem** (showing that the exponential formulation implies transcendence),
- **Liouville’s Theorem** (rational approximation arguments),

we conclude that \( S^* \) is transcendental. This confirms that no polynomial with rational coefficients can have \( S^* \) as a root.
