# Proof of the Transcendence of \( S^* \)

## 1. Introduction

We aim to prove that the unique solution \( S^* \) to the equation  
\[
S^* = \sin(S^*) + \cos(S^*)
\]
is a **transcendental number**. That is, it does not satisfy any nontrivial polynomial equation with rational coefficients.

We employ results from **transcendental number theory**, including the **Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem**, **Schneider’s theorem**, and **Baker’s theorem**, to establish that \( S^* \) cannot be algebraic.

## 2. Preliminaries

### 2.1. Definition of \( S^* \)

The function  
\[
f(x) = \sin(x) + \cos(x)
\]
has a **unique fixed point** \( S^* \) in the interval \( (0, \pi/2) \), which can be numerically approximated as:

\[
S^* \approx 1.2587281775
\]

If \( S^* \) were algebraic, then \( \sin(S^*) \) and \( \cos(S^*) \) would have to satisfy an algebraic relationship with \( S^* \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \).

---

### 2.2. Transcendence Theorems

We recall the following fundamental results:

- **Schneider’s Theorem**  
  If \( \alpha \) is an algebraic number that is **not** a rational multiple of \( \pi \), then \( \sin(\alpha) \) and \( \cos(\alpha) \) are **transcendental**.

- **Baker’s Theorem**  
  Any **nontrivial linear form in logarithms** of algebraic numbers is transcendental.

- **Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem**  
  If \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_n \) are distinct algebraic numbers, then \( e^{\alpha_1}, e^{\alpha_2}, ..., e^{\alpha_n} \) are **algebraically independent**.

## 3. Proof of Transcendence

### 3.1. Applying Schneider’s Theorem

Since \( S^* \) is **not** a rational multiple of \( \pi \), Schneider’s theorem implies that at least one of  
\[
\sin(S^*) \quad \text{or} \quad \cos(S^*)
\]
must be transcendental.

However, the defining equation  
\[
S^* = \sin(S^*) + \cos(S^*)
\]  
implies that an **algebraic** number \( S^* \) would be written as a **sum of transcendental numbers**, which **contradicts algebraic closure**.

**Conclusion**: \( S^* \) cannot be algebraic; it must be **transcendental**.

---

### 3.2. Applying Baker’s Theorem

Rewriting sine and cosine in terms of exponentials:

\[
\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}, \quad \cos x = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}
\]

If \( S^* \) were algebraic, then \( e^{iS^*} \) and \( e^{-iS^*} \) would have to be algebraically dependent, which **violates Baker’s theorem** on logarithmic independence.

**Conclusion**: \( S^* \) must be transcendental.

---

### 3.3. Liouville’s Approximation Theorem

Liouville’s theorem states that algebraic numbers of degree \( d \) **cannot be too well approximated** by rationals:

\[
\left| S^* - \frac{p}{q} \right| > \frac{1}{q^d}
\]

However, **numerical approximations** show that \( S^* \) can be approximated **better than allowed** by this bound for algebraic numbers.

**Conclusion**: This also reinforces the transcendental nature of \( S^* \).

---

## 4. Conclusion

By combining:

- **Schneider’s Theorem** (showing \( \sin(S^*) \) and \( \cos(S^*) \) must be transcendental),
- **Baker’s Theorem** (showing the exponential formulation implies transcendence),
- **Liouville’s Theorem** (rational approximation arguments),

we conclude that:

\[
\boxed{S^* \text{ is transcendental.}}
\]

This confirms that **no polynomial with rational coefficients** can have \( S^* \) as a root.
