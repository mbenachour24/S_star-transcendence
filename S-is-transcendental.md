# Proof of the Transcendence of S*

## 1. Introduction

We aim to prove that the unique solution `S*` to the equation  
`S* = sin(S*) + cos(S*)`  
is a **transcendental number** — meaning it does **not** satisfy any nontrivial polynomial equation with rational coefficients.

We use results from **transcendental number theory**, including **Lindemann-Weierstrass**, **Schneider’s theorem**, and **Baker’s theorem**, to demonstrate that `S*` cannot be algebraic.

## 2. Preliminaries

### 2.1. Definition of S*

The function `f(x) = sin(x) + cos(x)` has a **unique fixed point** `S*` in the interval `(0, π/2)`.  
This fixed point can be numerically approximated as:

S* ≈ 1.2587281775

If `S*` were algebraic, then `sin(S*)` and `cos(S*)` would have to satisfy an algebraic relationship with `S*` over the rationals.

### 2.2. Transcendence Theorems

**Schneider’s Theorem**  
If `α` is an algebraic number that is not a rational multiple of `π`, then `sin(α)` and `cos(α)` are transcendental.

**Baker’s Theorem**  
Any nontrivial linear combination of logarithms of algebraic numbers is transcendental.

**Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem**  
If `α₁, α₂, ..., αₙ` are distinct algebraic numbers, then `exp(α₁), exp(α₂), ..., exp(αₙ)` are algebraically independent.

## 3. Proof of Transcendence

### 3.1. Applying Schneider’s Theorem

Since `S*` is **not** a rational multiple of `π`, Schneider’s theorem implies that at least one of `sin(S*)` or `cos(S*)` must be transcendental.

But we also have the defining equation:

S* = sin(S*) + cos(S*)

This would imply that an **algebraic number** is equal to the **sum of transcendental numbers**, which is impossible under the closure of algebraic numbers.

**Conclusion:** `S*` must be transcendental.

### 3.2. Applying Baker’s Theorem

We can express sine and cosine using exponentials:

sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix)) / (2i)
cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix)) / 2

If `S*` were algebraic, then `e^(i·S*)` would need to be algebraic as well.  
But this contradicts Baker’s theorem, which says such combinations must be transcendental.

**Conclusion:** `S*` is transcendental.

### 3.3. Liouville’s Approximation Theorem

Liouville’s theorem says that algebraic numbers of degree `d` cannot be too well approximated by rational numbers. In particular:

|S* - p/q| > 1 / q^d

Numerical experiments show that `S*` can be approximated **far better** than this bound allows for any fixed degree `d`.  
This again supports the idea that `S*` is **not** algebraic.

## 4. Conclusion

Using:

- Schneider’s Theorem (about sine and cosine of algebraic inputs),
- Baker’s Theorem (on exponential/logarithmic transcendence),
- Liouville’s Theorem (on rational approximations),

we conclude:

S* is transcendental.

No polynomial with rational coefficients can have `S*` as a root.
